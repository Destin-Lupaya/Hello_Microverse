# Hello_Microverse
Setting up a 'Hello Microverse' project

In this project, i will set up a "Hello world" repository.
No complex coding is required for this exercise. 
My goal here is to master all of the tools and 
best practices you learned about in previous steps. 
I will be using them in all Microverse projects 
and most likely in My future job as well, 
so it is important for me to know them!
I will also get My first code review.
This is also a process that will be used in all Microverse projects.
